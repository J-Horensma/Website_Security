# Encrypt And Decrypt A Variable

## PHP Language:

#### Requirements:
1.) PHP's "openssl module" (Installed by default, on up to date PHP versions)

#### Usage:

#### Encryption
In order for openssl to encrypt data, the data needs to be converted to a variable.
This section of the "Website_Security" repository, has an example script for testing encryption of user input. The script has an input for text, that converts the "$_POST['INPUT_NAME']" variable, to a data variable, that will be encrypted by openssl. 
You should store the key, and IV generated, by this script, somewhere secure, like in a database because the key and IV will be needed for openssl to decrypt the data, later. 

#### Decryption
In order for openssl, to decrypt the data, the key and IV generated by the encryption script, as well as the encrypted data, must be supplied as variables to the decryption script.

This script is a script based off the code at:
