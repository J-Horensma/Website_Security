# What Are Content Security Policy Reports?:
Content security policy reports, are reports by the "Content-Security-Policy" headers, when a directive is broken. To retrieve these reports, use the "csp_report.js"
file located, in the "js" folder, of this directory. Standard configurations for reporting, are limited in current browsers that support them, without support, the report will not be sent, so do the easy way and use "csp_report.js".
