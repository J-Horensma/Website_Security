# What Are "Pragma" Headers?:
"Pragma" headers can be used, to prevent older proxy servers, that do not understand the newer "Cache-Control" header, from caching information. These older servers are HTTP version 1.0.

## Usage:

#### HTML:

```html
<meta http-equiv="Cache-control" content="public">
```
