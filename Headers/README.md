# What Are Headers?:
HTTP headers are loaded, by the browser, before the page content. Headers are sent by http requests. The headers load, in the browser, before the page content, therefor, if a broken header directive, is detected, the page content can be stopped, or an error can be captured for analysis. This can prevent the execution, of the broken directive, or allow monitoring of security breaches, if set up properly.
